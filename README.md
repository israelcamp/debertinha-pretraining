# Replaced Token Detection Made Easy

This repo introduces code for training an [ELECTRA-style](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10555) transformer in the same way as [DeBERTaV3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09543).

We base on the [HuggingFace's Transformers and Accelerate](https://huggingface.co/docs) libraries to write the script.

It is in no way extensive and complete, but gives a good starting point for further research.
